### Technical requirements 

- JavaScript code must be native, without the use of libraries,
frameworks or plugins (eg jQuery)
- The console must be free of any errors
- The names of all variables/classes must not contain Cyrillic or
translit. No changes
- The final version should be built on any modular structure. IN
We plan to expand in the future.
- Workability in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera,
IE11, Edge, Safari)
- Animations are very welcome, but also left to your discretion
(set classes from animate.css can be changed as you like)
- Using ES6
